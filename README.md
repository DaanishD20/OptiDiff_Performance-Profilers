# OptiDiff: A Visual LLVM Optimization Analyzer
OptiDiff is an interactive web application designed to demystify the LLVM optimization pipeline. It provides a clear, visual, and intuitive way to compare and analyze the effects of different compiler optimization levels on C/C++ code. By parsing and visualizing detailed debug information from the LLVM opt tool, OptiDiff opens up the "black box" of the compiler for students, developers, and performance engineers.

# Key Features
High-Level IR Comparison: Get a side-by-side, color-coded diff of the final LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) generated by two different optimization levels (e.g., -O1 vs. -O2).

Interactive Pass Explorer: Dive deep into the pipeline. Select any individual pass run to see a focused diff of the IR immediately before and after it was executed.

Performance Metrics Dashboard: Understand the performance characteristics of the optimization process with clear visualizations:

Execution Time Chart: A bar chart highlighting the most computationally expensive passes.

Pass Distribution Chart: A pie chart showing which passes run most frequently.

Simplified Workflow: A user-friendly interface that requires only a C/C++ source file to initiate a full analysis.

# Technology Stack
Backend: Python

Frontend: Streamlit

Data Handling: Pandas

Visualization: Matplotlib, Streamlit native charts

Core Toolchain: Clang and LLVM opt

# Setup and Installation
To run OptiDiff locally, you will need Python and the LLVM toolchain (including clang and opt) installed and available in your system's PATH.

1. Prerequisites:

Python 3.8+

LLVM / Clang (Version 12 or newer recommended)

Ensure clang and opt are accessible from your terminal.

2. Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourUsername]/OptiDiff.git
cd OptiDiff

3. Install Dependencies:
It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

4. Run the Application:
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Streamlit server.

streamlit run optidiff_app.py

The application will open automatically in your web browser.

# How to Use
Launch the App: Run streamlit run app.py in your terminal.

Select Optimization Levels: Use the radio buttons in the sidebar to choose the "Before" (Left Pane) and "After" (Right Pane) optimization levels you want to compare.

Upload Your Code: Click the "Upload C/C++ Source File" button and select a .c or .cpp file from your computer.

Run Analysis: Click the "ðŸš€ Run Analysis" button. The tool will invoke clang and opt in the background. This may take a few moments.

Explore the Results:

The main view will show the final IR diff.

Navigate to the "Pass Explorer" tab to inspect individual pass transformations.

Go to the "Pass Metrics" tab to see the performance charts.
